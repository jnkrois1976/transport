                    Your vehicle is transported on an open car carrier much like the ones used to deliver new cars from the manufacturer to the dealers,
                    usually 8 to 10 vehicles per carrier.<br /><br />
                    Your vehicle will be picked up at your door or as close as possible, and will be delivered to your door or as close as possible as some residential restrictions apply.
                    Open Transport usually costs less than Enclosed Transport.

                    Your vehicle will be transported in a completely enclosed trailer, usually 3 to 6 vehicles per carrier, designed to haul classic automobiles or
                    vehicles that should not be exposed to inclement weather.<br /><br />
                    Like Open Transports, your vehicle will be picked up at your door or as close as possible in an Enclosed Trailer,
                    and will be delivered to your door or as close as possible, as some residential restrictions apply.<br /><br />
                    The cost for Enclosed Transport is roughly 33-50% more than Open Transport.

                    We do not use terminals where vehicles are known to sit for many weeks.<br /><br />
                    We instead hire carriers whose plan it is to ship door to door, or as close as possible.<br /><br />
                    We find that is the fastest and most reliable method for shipping customer vehicles.
